# 🔐 Phishing Link Detector App

An AI-powered Android app that detects phishing URLs using a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model. This application helps users stay safe from malicious websites and phishing attempts in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time phishing URL detection
- 🧠 TensorFlow Lite model integration
- 🗂️ Uses real phishing datasets (CSV and TXT format)
- 📱 Built with Android Studio (Kotlin)
- 🔒 Helps prevent malicious web access

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Framework**: Android SDK
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`)
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Gradle, CSV/TXT datasets

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The app takes a user-entered or extracted URL.
2. It extracts relevant features from the URL.
3. The input is passed to a **TensorFlow Lite model** for classification.
4. The result is displayed: **Safe** or **Phishing**.

## 📦 Dataset Sources

- `phishing_site_urls.csv`
- `phishing-links-ACTIVE.txt`
- `phishing-IPs-ACTIVE.txt`

These files contain known phishing URLs/IPs used to validate or train the model.

## 📱 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-link-detector.git '''bash
2.Open in Android Studio.
3.Sync Gradle and run the app on an emulator or real device.

##🤖 TensorFlow Lite Model
The model was trained using a neural network classifier with extracted features from phishing URLs. It was converted to .tflite for mobile compatibility.

##🧠 Future Improvements
-Add support for scanning SMS and emails for links
-Improve accuracy using ensemble models
-Add URL preview before opening
-Integrate with browsers for real-time protection
